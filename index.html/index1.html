        it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML),Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of website
        production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a
        simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various
        different browsers, devices and screen sizes</p>
