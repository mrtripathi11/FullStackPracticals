        JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
        curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.Alongside
        HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables
        interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
        client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
